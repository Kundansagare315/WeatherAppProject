Creating a weather app using servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 


1) Design the User Interface (UI):

Create an HTML file for the front-end layout.
Style the UI using CSS to make it visually appealing.
Use JavaScript to handle user interactions and make asynchronous requests to the server.

2) Set up the Server:

Use Java servlets to handle HTTP requests and responses.
Configure the servlet to respond to requests for weather data.

3) Retrieve Weather Data:

Integrate with a weather API to fetch weather data. 
Popular weather APIs include OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack, or WeatherAPI.

4) Display Weather Information:

Parse the JSON response from the weather API in the servlet.
Send the relevant weather information back to the client-side (JSP or JavaScript).

5) Frontend Integration:

Update the UI dynamically with the weather information received from the server.
Use AJAX or Fetch API in JavaScript to make asynchronous requests to the servlet.

6) Error Handling and Validation:

Implement error handling for cases like invalid user input or failed API requests.
Validate user input on the client-side (JavaScript) and server-side (Java).

  Files  Structure :

index.html: Contains the UI elements for users to input the location and display the weather information.

style.css: Contains the CSS styling for the UI.

script.js: Contains JavaScript code for handling user interactions and making requests to the server.

WeatherServlet.java: Java servlet that receives requests, retrieves weather data, and sends the response back to the client.

index.jsp: JSP file that receives data from the servlet and dynamically generates HTML content to display weather information.
